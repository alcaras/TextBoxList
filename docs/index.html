<h1>TextboxList: A <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">Prototype.js</a> based Text Box List</h1>

<p><a href="index.html">Home Page</a></p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/tfluehr/TextBoxList">GitHub Project Page</a></p>

<p>Simplest description is that TextboxList is a control for organizing/controlling a list of data in a HTML Text Box.</p>

<p>But, things are never that simple . . .</p>

<p>This started off as a simple project to refactor/optimize the Proto!MultiSelect control from <a href="http://interiders.com/">http://interiders.com/</a> but it grew into something much more.</p>

<p>You will really need to check out the <a href="api.html">API Documentation</a> and the <a href="demos.html">Demos</a> to really understand what TextboxList is capable of.</p>

<p>But basically everything is an option</p>

<p>Just a few of the choices:</p>

<ul>
<li>with or without autocomplete </li>
<li>ajax or non ajax </li>
<li>customizable keys to select and/or add items </li>
<li>customizable regular expressions for matching/highlighting</li>
<li>and much more . . .</li>
</ul>

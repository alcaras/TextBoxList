TextboxList: A [Prototype.js][1] based Text Box List
========================================

[HomePage][2]

Simplest description is that TextboxList is a control for organizing/controlling a list of data in a HTML Text Box.

But, things are never that simple . . .

This started off as a simple project to refactor/optimize the Proto!MultiSelect control from [http://interiders.com/][3] but it grew into something much more.

You will really need to check out the [API Documentation][4] and the [Demos][5] to really understand what TextboxList is capable of.

But basically everything is an option

Just a few of the choices:

 * with or without autocomplete 
 * ajax or non ajax 
 * customizable keys to select and/or add items 
 * customizable regular expressions for matching/highlighting
 * and much more . . .
